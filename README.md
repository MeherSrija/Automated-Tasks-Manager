# Automated Task Management

### Project Overview: Task Reminder System

**1. Vision Statement**
To create a smart task management system in Salesforce that improves productivity by automating reminders, ensuring timely task completion, and providing managers with clear visibility into team performance.

---

**2. The Problem**
In many organizations, employees and sales reps track their tasks using spreadsheets, emails, or manual notes. This leads to **missed deadlines, poor follow-ups, and lack of accountability**. Managers struggle to monitor overdue tasks and team performance due to disconnected systems and manual tracking.

**3. The Solution**
The Automated Task Management system will leverage **Salesforce CRM** to centralize task creation, assignment, and tracking. Using **automation (Flows/Workflows)**, the system will send timely reminders to assigned users before deadlines. Reports and dashboards will provide **real-time visibility** into task progress, overdue items, and workload distribution.
